# AffineCipher
An affine cipher allows us to encrypt a text using two keys. Each element of the alphabet is represented as an element of the complete system of residues modulo N, where N is the cardinality of the alphabet. In addition to encryption and decryption functions, frequency analysis is also implemented.
