# AffineCipher
An affine cipher allows us to encrypt a text using two keys. Each element of the alphabet is represented as an element of the complete system of residues modulo N, where N is the cardinality of the alphabet. You can enter the key yourself, or you can generate it in the program. In addition to encryption and decryption functions, frequency analysis is also implemented.
